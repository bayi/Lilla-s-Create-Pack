# Lilla's Create Tech Pack

This is a simple Forge-based modpack designed to offer a seamless blend of automation, engineering, and creativity. Originally developed for private multiplayer sessions with friends, this pack has been fine-tuned to provide an engaging experience that others can enjoy as well.

At its core, the modpack revolves around the powerful Create mod and its many expansions, enabling players to construct intricate contraptions and automate complex tasks in a visually appealing way. Whether you’re designing advanced machinery, setting up sophisticated production lines, or creating stunning architectural marvels, this pack provides the tools to bring your ideas to life.

Beyond Create, the modpack features a carefully curated selection of technology-focused mods that enhance automation, energy systems, and engineering possibilities. Immersive Engineering introduces realistic power generation, multiblock machines, and a structured approach to industrialization, while Tinkers' Construct allows for deep customization of tools and weapons, ensuring players can craft the perfect equipment for any situation.

Storage and automation are also key aspects of the pack. Applied Energistics 2 manages high-tech inventory systems and auto-crafting, while ComputerCraft enables programmable automation for those who enjoy scripting and logic-based solutions. Farmer’s Delight alongside with Naturalist enriches the survival experience with expanded food mechanics, adding another layer of depth to farming and cooking.

To top it all off, a custom resource pack included provides Hungarian translations for most included mods, making the experience more accessible to Hungarian-speaking players.
