# Lilla's Create Tech Pack

![Icon](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bayi/Lilla-s-Create-Pack/refs/heads/main/assets/Lilla-Create128.png)

A simple Fabric modpack centered around Create, ComputerCraft, Farmer's Delight and Applied Energistics 2. 
We play this together with friends on a private server, and maybe others would enjoy it too.

The main goal of the modpack is automation while still allowing players to build fancy structures with ease. The modpack also includes my resource pack with Hungarian translations, where I strive to provide translations for most of the included mods.
