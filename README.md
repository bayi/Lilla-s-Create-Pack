# Lilla's Create Tech Pack

![Icon](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bayi/Lilla-s-Create-Pack/refs/heads/main/assets/Lilla-Create128.png)

A simple fabric modpack centered around Create, ComputerCraft, Farmer's Delight and Applied Energistics 2. 
We are playing this together with friends on a private server and maybe others would enjoy it too.

The main goal of the modpack is automatization while still be able to build fancy stuff with ease. The modpack includes my resource pack with hungarian translations where i try to provide translations for most of the mods.

I tried to balance everything as much as possible, but feedback is always welcome if you want to have something changed.
